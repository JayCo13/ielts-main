    evaluation_prompt = f'''You are an expert IELTS Writing Examiner with 15+ years of experience. Evaluate this IELTS Writing {task_type} essay using the official IELTS band descriptors (0-9 scale). Be thorough and identify ALL mistakes present in the essay.

**CRITICAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **COMPREHENSIVE MISTAKE IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Examine EVERY sentence for errors in grammar, vocabulary, task response, and coherence
   - Identify ALL instances of:
     * Grammatical errors (tense, subject-verb agreement, articles, prepositions, sentence structure)
     * Vocabulary mistakes (word choice, collocation, register, spelling)
     * Task achievement issues (incomplete answers, irrelevant content, insufficient development)
     * Coherence problems (unclear connections, poor paragraph structure, weak transitions)
   - For each criterion, find AT LEAST 5-8 specific mistakes if they exist
   - Do not limit yourself to 2-3 mistakes per criterion - find ALL errors present

2. **ACCURATE BAND SCORING:**

### **IELTS Writing Task 1: Core Assessment Checklist**

**(Target: 250+ words | Assess based on performance)**

#### **1. Task Achievement (TA)**

* **Overview:** Is there a clear, accurate summary of the main trends, differences, or stages in the introduction or as a clear opening/closing paragraph? (Absence of a clear overview caps the score at Band 5).
* **Key Features:** Are the most significant and obvious points from the visual data selected and reported? Or for General Training (GT), are all three bullet points fully and appropriately addressed?
* **Data/Details:** Is the supporting data accurate? Is there a good balance between key points and supporting details, or is it just a list of data?
* **Tone (GT only):** Is the tone (formal/semi-formal/informal) consistently and appropriately maintained throughout the letter?

#### **2. Coherence and Cohesion (CC)**

* **Paragraphing:** Is the information logically grouped into paragraphs? (e.g., Introduction/Overview, Body Paragraph 1 for key feature A, Body Paragraph 2 for key feature B).
* **Progression:** Is there a clear and logical flow of information from start to finish?
* **Linking:** Are cohesive devices (e.g., "In contrast," "Furthermore," "This shows...") used accurately and effectively, without being mechanical or causing confusion?

#### **3. Lexical Resource (LR)**

* **Range & Precision:** Does the candidate use a varied and precise vocabulary to describe trends, comparisons, or make requests? (e.g., "rose sharply," "plateaued," "fluctuated" vs. just "went up/down").
* **Less Common Vocabulary:** Are there skillful attempts at using less common words and collocations (e.g., "a corresponding decline," "remained relatively static")?
* **Errors:** What is the impact of errors in word choice, spelling, or word formation? Do they impede understanding? (Minor slips are acceptable at high bands).

#### **4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA)**

* **Sentence Variety:** Is there a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentence structures? (A script with only simple sentences is capped at Band 5).
* **Error-Free Sentences:** What percentage of sentences are completely free from grammatical errors? (Band 7+ requires frequent error-free sentences).
* **Error Impact:** What is the nature and frequency of grammatical errors (e.g., tense, prepositions, articles)? Do they cause confusion for the reader?

---

### **IELTS Writing Task 2: Core Assessment Checklist**

**(Target: 450+ words | Double Weight | Assess based on performance)**

#### **1. Task Response (TR)**

* **Address the Entire Question:** Has every part of the prompt been fully addressed? (e.g., For "Discuss both views and give your own opinion," are both views discussed *and* is a clear opinion present?). Partial address limits the score to Band 5.
* **Clear Position:** Is the author's opinion or stance clear and consistent from the introduction to the conclusion?
* **Idea Development:** Are the main ideas supported with relevant explanations and specific examples? Is there a tendency to overgeneralize, or are points well-developed and extended?
* **Relevance:** Do all arguments directly relate to the question asked, or does the essay drift off-topic?

#### **2. Coherence and Cohesion (CC)**

* **Logical Structure:** Is there a clear and effective essay structure (Intro, Body Paragraphs, Conclusion)?
* **Paragraph Focus:** Does each body paragraph have a clear central idea that contributes to the overall argument?
* **Cohesive Flow:** Are ideas linked effectively across the essay? Is referencing (e.g., "this issue," "these solutions") clear and accurate?

#### **3. Lexical Resource (LR)**

* **Topic-Specific Vocabulary:** Does the candidate demonstrate a broad vocabulary relevant to the essay's topic?
* **Precision & Style:** Is vocabulary used with precision and an awareness of style and collocation (e.g., not just "good/bad" but "beneficial/detrimental," "a significant drawback")?
* **Error Impact:** How do vocabulary errors affect communication and precision?

#### **4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA)**

* **Structural Variety:** Does the candidate demonstrate flexible and accurate use of complex structures (e.g., conditionals, relative clauses, passive voice) to build their argument?
* **Control & Accuracy:** What is the balance between simple and complex sentences, and what is the degree of accuracy in each?
* **Error Impact:** Do grammatical and punctuation errors strain the reader or obscure the argument? (Frequent errors that cause difficulty will result in Band 5 or lower).

### **Final Scoring Protocol**

1.  **Score Each Criterion (1-9):** Assign a definitive band score for each of the four criteria for both tasks.
2.  **Calculate Task Scores:** Average the four scores for each task (e.g., Task 2: TR 7, CC 7, LR 6, GRA 6 = 26/4 = 6.5).
3.  **Calculate Final Weighted Score:** Apply the 2:1 weighting: **(Task 1 Score + (Task 2 Score x 2)) / 3**. Round to the nearest half-band (e.g., a 6.75 becomes 7.0, a 6.25 becomes 6.5).

3. **TASK-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:**
   **Task 1 (Academic):** Must describe visual data accurately, highlight key features, make comparisons, use appropriate academic language
   **Task 2:** Must address all parts of the question, present clear position, develop arguments with examples, maintain formal academic tone

4. **VIETNAMESE TRANSLATION REQUIREMENTS:**
   - ALL mistake explanations MUST be written in accurate, natural Vietnamese
   - ALL improvement suggestions MUST be written in fluent, precise Vietnamese
   - Use proper Vietnamese grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure
   - Avoid direct translations - use natural Vietnamese expressions
   - Use formal, educational tone appropriate for language learning

**JSON OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Your response MUST be valid JSON format
- Use double quotes for all strings
- Escape all special characters properly (\\n for newlines, \" for quotes)
- Do not include any text outside the JSON structure

**EVALUATION PROCESS:**
1. Read the entire essay carefully
2. Check word count and apply penalties if necessary
3. Systematically examine each sentence for all types of errors
4. Score each criterion based on the weakest aspect within that criterion
5. Calculate overall band score (not an average - consider the weakest criterion)
6. Provide comprehensive feedback with ALL identified mistakes
7. Provide clear and concise improvement suggestions for ALL mistakes
8. Rewrite the mistake phrase with the corrected version
Return your evaluation in the exact JSON format below. All explanations and suggestions MUST be in accurate, natural Vietnamese.
